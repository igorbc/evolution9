{"name":"Evolution Nine","tagline":"Can you help them evolve and reach the goal?","body":"### About the game\r\nEvolution Nine is an unfinished 2D platform game that uses concepts of genetic algorithms. In the game the player watches nine creatures move and jump randomly, one at a time, in a level containing platforms, obstacles and possibly other objects. The level will also contain an object representing the goal, so that when the creature touches this object the level will be cleared and the player will be taken to the next level. The player’s part is to select the creatures whose movements he/she thinks takes it closer to the preferred path towards the goal object. After the player selects some creatures, another generation is bred from the ones selected and they move around again, one by one. This process will repeat until the player manages to make the creatures’ movements converge in the desired way so that the goal object is reached.\r\n\r\nThe game can be played [here](http://igorbc.github.io/evolution9/en.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
